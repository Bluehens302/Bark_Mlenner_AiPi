# 🧬 Bark Mlenner: The AI Lab Manager

**Bark Mlenner** is an automated AI assistant designed to streamline molecular biology lab handovers. It lives inside your Google Docs and Calendar, acting as a virtual Lab Manager that ensures continuity between student shifts.

## ✨ Features

* **🤖 Automated Daily Handovers:** Checks your Lab Calendar for the next scheduled student and writes a customized "Handover" note at 8:00 PM every night.
* **📚 Protocol Enforcement:** Reads your **Master Protocols** Google Doc to ensure all advice follows your specific lab rules (e.g., specific cloning strains, incubation temps, or buffer recipes).
* **⚡ Interactive Help:** Students can highlight any text in the notebook and ask Bark Mlenner to explain it or draft a step-by-step protocol instantly via a custom menu.
* **🧠 Context-Aware Advice:** Combines what was *just done* (Notebook) with how it *should be done* (Protocols) to catch mistakes before they happen.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before installing, ensure you have:
1.  A **Google Account** (Personal or Workspace).
2.  A **Google Doc** to serve as the Lab Notebook (where students write daily logs).
3.  A **Google Doc** to serve as the Master Protocols (where your SOPs live).
4.  A **Google Calendar** for scheduling shifts.

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Step 1: Create the Documents
1.  **Lab Notebook:** Create a Google Doc where students will write their daily logs.
2.  **Master Protocols:** Create a separate Google Doc containing all your lab's Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).
    * *Tip: Use clear headings like "PROTOCOL 1: CLONING" so the AI can read it easily.*

### Step 2: Get Your Document ID
You need to tell the script where to find your protocols.
1.  Open your **Master Protocols** Google Doc.
2.  Look at the URL in your browser address bar.
3.  Copy the long string of random letters and numbers between `/d/` and `/edit`.
    * *Example URL:* `docs.google.com/document/d/`**`1atFfk3Az...7E1COkwZD4A`**`/edit`
    * *You need the bold part.*

### Step 3: Get Your API Key
Bark Mlenner uses Google's Gemini AI. You need a free API key to give him a brain.
1.  Go to **[Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)**.
2.  Sign in with your Google Account.
3.  Click on the **"Get API Key"** button (or the key icon on the left sidebar).
4.  Click **"Create API Key"**.
5.  **Copy the key** (it starts with `AIza...`).
    * *⚠️ Security Warning: Keep this key private. Do not share it publicly.*

### Step 4: Install the Script
1.  Open your **Lab Notebook** Google Doc.
2.  Go to top menu: **Extensions** > **Apps Script**.
3.  Delete any existing code in the editor and paste the `Bark Mlenner` script code.

### Step 5: Configure the Variables
At the top of the script, look for the `CONFIGURATION` section and update these three lines with the data you gathered in Steps 2 & 3:

```javascript
// 1. Paste the API Key you copied in Step 3 here (keep the quotes!)
const GEMINI_API_KEY = "AIzaSy..."; 

// 2. Enter the EXACT name of your Lab Calendar
const CALENDAR_NAME = "Team Timer"; 

// 3. Paste the Protocol Doc ID you copied in Step 2 here
const PROTOCOL_DOC_ID = "1atFfk3Az...";
